## Now

ajkbssn is 50 something.
He is working on something to help us all understand the economy.
Economics used to be the science of limited resources, but to his surprise today it is more about what we can easily measure.
He thinks those things are to a great extent not limited.

He is also tired of the discussion on finding an alternative to GDP.
Frankly it does not matter if we measure GDP or tweak it.
What matters is if we understand what resources are limited and start to analyze how we should form the rules for the economy to create the right incentives to live happy, healthy lifes.

Having used Excel and VBA as the main tools to model analyze the world since 1990 ajkbssn is dipping his toes into Jupyter Notebooks and plain Python coding. Bullet journal and github helps.
